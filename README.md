# BikeStores


Using **SQL** I pulled the relevant data from the available dataset. Then I designed a **Dynamic Dashboard** using **Excel**.


## Step 1: Understanding the Problem
Management wants to know the condition of *sales activities* within the company and gain insights into the various trends over the *sales volume* over the *2016-2018 period*. They also want to know the *revenues* per region, per store, per product category, and per brand. And finally, a list of the *top customers* and *sales rep*. 

Provide management with a comprehensive dashboard that would allow them to easily visualize the desired metrics. 

## Step 2: Collect and Gather Data
BikeStores dataset gathered from sqlservertutorial.net (https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-sample-database/)

## Step 3: Clean The Data Using SQL
